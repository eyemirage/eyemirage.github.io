<h2>Where and when do I go?</h2>
<div>Step 1: Come to Berlin. If you’re already in Berlin, you’re doing well. 
</div>
<div>Step 2: Wait until Saturday 10 June, 2023 at 19:00</div>
<div>Step 3: Goto Prachtwerk  &bull; Ganghoferstraße 2, Berlin  &bull;  <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/GqMZYg6TSN9nkFah9" target="_blank">See a map</a>
</div>
<div>Step 4: Have fun until 3:00</div>

<h2>Do I wear something?</h2>
<div>Yes, please. This won’t be a traditionally formal wedding party so wear something casual/nice, or just plain fun. Or go crazy with a top hat, monocle, and cane. 
</div>

<h2>What’s this I heard about Uruguay?</h2>
<div>As an international couple we’ve had to account for some global logistics. We decided to split things up with a civil wedding in Uruguay last February for Vivi’s side of the family/friends. Now it’s time for the European wedding party (which is much easier to get to from Canada)!</div>

<h2>“Oh no, what should I bring as a gift?” </h2>
<div>We don’t need gifts - your friendship and/or family bond is a gift enough! Especially when you might be flying across an ocean to see us. If you’re still wanting to, then….</div>

<h2>Why are you overusing exclamation marks?!</h2>
<div>We’re excited!!!!</div>
